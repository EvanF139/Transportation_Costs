Using cross reference sheet previously shown, played around with the Indirect, Row(), and Column() functions.
This allowed me to only have to enter the data from COUNTY to COUNTY once and it was reflected on its counterpart in the other part of the Excel sheet.
Mainly just trial and error until I got it to work.
"0" line will refer to the top left to bottom right diagonal line created by ATLANTIC - ATLANTIC being 0, BERGEN - BERGEN being 0, etc.

ATLANTIC COUNTY - ATLANTIC COUNTY BEING CELL B2 FOR REFERENCE:

I wanted the measurement of Atlantic - Bergen to be reflected both in cells B3 and C2, with C2 being the reflected cell.
C2=INDIRECT("B" & ROW() + COLUMN() - 2)

I then copy and pasted that formula to the cell DOWN 1, RIGHT 1 and would adjust accordingly: C2=INDIRECT("B" & ROW() + COLUMN() - 2)
                                                                                              D3=INDIRECT("C" & ROW() + COLUMN() - 3)

This allowed me to paste the distance from GMAPs to the cells to the bottom left of the "0" line and have the values be reflected to the top right.
