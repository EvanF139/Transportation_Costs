Template I am using to build out the distance maps.
Will use the driving distance in miles to multiply by the reefer rate on trucking to get very high level understanding of cost between counties.
Looking to integrate this for every vegetable to see what it would cost to drive 1 pallet from X County to Y County with X being a county with abundance and Y being a county with a deficit.
